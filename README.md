# santigualchi.data

## The project

**santigualchi.data** is a personal project where I apply my professional skills
and favorite data science tools to explore topics that interest me. On my
Instagram account,
**[@santigualchi.data](https://www.instagram.com/santigualchi.data/)**,
I showcase the results of this project, transforming raw data into compelling
stories.

But that's not all. Each story is developed according to
**[Serious Data Science](https://posit.co/blog/driving-real-lasting-value-with-serious-data-science/)**
principles, and all the code used to generate each slide is publicly available
in separate repositories. This way, anyone interested can examine the code and
learn from it.
